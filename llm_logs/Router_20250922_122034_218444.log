Consider the following constraints for your answer schema (keys and types): \"approach\" must be a string from {\"rag\", \"sql\", \"hybrid\"}, \"confidence\" should reflect how confident you are in choosing this method on a scale of 0 to 1, where 1 is absolutely certain; it's not just about the suitability but also considering potential performance and scalability. The reasoning must be detailed enough that someone unfamiliar with SQL or data processing could understand why your choice stands out even when faced with similar problems involving date calculations in large datasets (over a million records).\n\nInput: \n{\n  \"question\": \"Identify the top five products by total sales volume for each quarter of fiscal year 2.1, excluding any product that has not been sold at least once every month within those quarters.\",\n  \"ontological_blocks\": [],\n  \"expected_answer_type\": \"\"\n}\n\nReturn JSON ONLY matching this schema (keys and types):\n{\n  \"approach\": \"string\",\n  \"confidence\": float, // A value between 0.0 to 1.0 indicating your confidence level in the chosen approach considering performance on large datasets with complex conditions like monthly sales consistency checks across quarters of a fiscal year.\n  \"reasoning\": \"A detailed explanation that includes why this method is suitable for handling relational data, date-based calculations over multiple periods (quarters), and ensuring product availability throughout the period in question.\"\n}\n\n"
