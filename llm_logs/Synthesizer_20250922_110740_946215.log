The confidence level is set at 1.0 because there are no uncertainties in interpreting or processing these inputs to reach an answer that fits within the specified schema.\n\nThe explanation briefly states how we arrived at our final response, noting specifically where this information was sourced from (the SQL_Results). The citation is a direct reference back to the provided data source which confirms and supports our conclusion about total revenue for 2013 being $38633120.01 as per given results, ensuring transparency in how we derived this answer from available information.\n\nSince there were no errors or issues with previous attempts mentioned (error_message is empty), and rag chunks are not applicable here due to the absence of contextual text data that could be broken down into meaningful segments for analysis, they have been omitted as per instructions. The confidence level reflects a high degree of certainty in this answer given there were no ambiguities or missing pieces from which we had to infer our response; it is based solely on the provided SQL results and schema requirements."
