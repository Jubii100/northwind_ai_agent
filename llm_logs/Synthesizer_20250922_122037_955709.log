Since actual SQL results are not available, and there's no real data to analyze or reference in the provided inputs (rag_chunks, ontological blocks), I have created hypothetical product names ('ProductA', 'ProductB') as placeholders for where a list of products would be if we had valid query outputs. The confidence level is set at 0.0 due to lacking data and contextual information needed to perform the analysis or generate real results, which aligns with best practices when dealing with incomplete datasets in automated systems.\n\nFor actual implementation, once proper SQL queries are executed against a database containing relevant tables (e.g., 'Products', 'Inventory'), we would expect an output similar to:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": [{\"product\": \"ProductA\"}, {\"product\": \"ProductB\"}],\n  \"confidence\": 1.0, // Assuming the query is correct and data exists in database tables\n  \"explanation\": \"The SQL results provided contain valid entries that match products with UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder < ReorderLevel.\",\n  \"citations\": [\n    \"SQL_Query: SELECT product FROM Products WHERE (UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder) < ReorderLevel\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis example assumes the SQL query is correct and that there are corresponding records in a database. The confidence level would be higher if we had access to actual data, but it's set at zero here due to lack of information provided by `sql_results`."
