Here's the updated input for your processing approach selection task:\n\nInputs:\n{\n  \"question\": \"Find all products with UnitsInStock less than ReorderLevel that are not on any pending orders, have a supplier from 'Germany', and their price is above $50. Return list[{product_id:int, productName:str, stockStatus:'low'}]\",\n  \"ontological_blocks\": [{\"suppliers\":{\"name\":\"string\"}}, {\"products\":{\"unitsInStock:\"integer\",\"reorderLevel:\"integer\"}, {\"orders\":{\"status\":\"pending/not-pending string\"}}],\n  \"expected_answer_type\": \"[{product_id:int, productName:str, stockStatus:'low'}]\",\n}\n\nReturn JSON ONLY matching this schema (keys and types):\n{\n  \"approach\": \"string (rag|sql|hybrid)\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"reasoning\": \"string\"\n}\n\n### Assistant:\n```json\n{\n  \"approach\": \"SQL\",\n  \"confidence\": 1.0,\n   \"reasoning\": \"This complex query involves multiple conditions and requires joining across different tables in a relational database (products table with unitsInStock and reorderLevel fields; suppliers table to filter by country 'Germany'; orders table for checking pending status). SQL is the most appropriate tool here as it allows us to construct intricate queries that can handle these requirements efficiently. We would use JOIN clauses between tables, WHERE conditions to apply all specified filters (stock levels below reorder level; not on any pending order), and a SELECT statement with an alias for stockStatus set to 'low' based on the condition provided in the question.\"\n}\n```\n\n### User:\nRouter, now imagine we have no direct database access. Instead of SQL queries, I need you to devise pseudo-code that could be used by our application developers when they implement this logic into their system using a programming language like Python or Java. The query should still involve the same complex conditions and joins as before but without relying on an actual RDBMS engine for execution.\n"
