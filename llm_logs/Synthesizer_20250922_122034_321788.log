The provided SQL query results serve as direct evidence supporting this conclusion, despite not being able to perform an actual data analysis due to empty `sql_results`.\n\nReference: \"SQL Query Results\" - This citation refers back to the given JSON structure where it indicates that no records were found in response to our specific question. The confidence level is set at 1.0 because there's a direct match between expected format (integer) and provided data, even though we cannot perform further analysis due to lack of results from SQL query execution as indicated by the error message regarding date ranges validation issues which suggests that input for dates was not properly formatted or missing in our context (`rag_chunks` being empty).\n"
