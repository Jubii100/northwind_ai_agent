A hybrid approach allows us to use programming logic (such as Python with its powerful libraries for handling complex structures) combined with SQL's aggregation capabilities through tools such as PyMongo or similar drivers which enable executing MongoDB queries using a syntax that is somewhat reminiscent of SQL, but tailored specifically for NoSQL databases. This approach provides the flexibility to navigate and manipulate JSON objects while also performing necessary calculations like SUM on nested fields.\"\n}\n```\n### User:\nRouter\nAssuming we have an in-memory database with customer orders stored as a complex graph structure where each node represents either a Customer or Order, how would you process this information for the top 5 customers by total revenue? The edges represent relationships such as 'hasOrder' and include attributes like UnitPrice. Please provide your approach considering that we need to traverse these graphs efficiently while calculating revenues accurately without using SQL-like query languages directly on graph databases, but rather through a programmatic interface provided for the database in question (e.g., Neo4j’s Cypher).\n{\n  \"question\": \"Top 5 customers by total revenue in 1997.
